        <h1>Young Lives at Stake: How constant fear of deportation in childhood can affect your health forever</h1>

  Living with the fear of deportation is taking a psychological toll on New York City's immigrant communities.

<p>
  "The level of anxiety was enormous after the election," said George Finger, a coordinator at the Staten Island non-profit El Centro del Inmigrante, which provides social services for local immigrants.
</p>

<p>
  The families Finger serves worry about the potential arrest, loss of employment or deportation of family members. While not as severe as it was a year ago, he says, the fear has adapted into a less dramatic, more permanent form.
</p>

<p>
  "It's low level, chronic anxiety that wouldn’t be undetectable," said Finger.
</p>

<p>
  But recently, counselors and scientists have become particularly concerned about the long-term consequences this type of strain will have on children who worry that their caregivers or they themselves will be detained after an ICE raid.
</p>

<p>
  A number of studies in recent decades strongly suggest that worrying over a period of months or years can be as traumatizing to a child as divorce or the death of a parent. And the effects can last for decades.
</p>

<p>
  "We refer to this kind of strain as toxic stress," said Emily Bosk, professor of social work at Rutgers University.
   "And it really changes kids’ brains."
</p>
Bosk says prolonged exposure to challenging events can lead to changes to their adrenaline and cortisol metabolism, in turn altering their still-developing nervous systems.
</p>

<p>
The Centers for Disease Control landmark study on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) uncovered a link between toxic stress and health problems in adulthood, ranging from major depression to stroke. Using a 10-question retrospective survey of adults, researchers found that for every traumatic event or period of toxic stress a child endures, the higher his or her risk for many chronic and catastrophic medical conditions becomes.

<p>
Clinicians were have known for decades that developmental traumas had an effect on health througout the lifespan,
but the size and renown of the ACE study helped move the idea into mainstream medicine and helped lay people grasp the concepts by quantifying the increased risks
these children live with.
</p>

<p>
Respondents answer yes or no to questions about traumatizing conditions. For example, "Before your 18th birthday, did a parent or other adult in the household often or very often swear at you, insult you, put you down, or humiliate you?"

<div class="blurb">

  <p>
  The original ACE survey does not specifically ask about traumas related to family immigration status. We think the current version may miss a lot of people because it does not prompt them to think specifically about the stress of deportation.
  </p>

  <p>
  So we did a meta-analysis of dozens of studies from all over the world that measured the impact of Adverse Chldhood Experiences on different clinical presentations.
  </p>

<p>
By taking our version of the survey, you can estimate the impact of growing up with caregivers at risk of deportation.

<div class="methodology">
    Our Methodology:
    <p>
  We looked at studies measuring the impact of ACE score on various ailments: migraines, fetal death, depression, cancer, etc. For each illness that appears in our results, we used data from a particular study. These numbers are not predictions. They are based on numbers from other statistically representative populations.  All of our data was taken from studies of statistically representative populations that have been published in peer reviewed medical journals since 2001.
  </p>
</div>
<!-- closes methodology div -->


<div class="article-text">

<p>
  Results of the study have been consistently reproduced internationally over the nearly 20 years since it was published. But while the simple survey at the heart of the research is considered the gold standard for quantifying the health costs from developmental trauma, it is not without its drawbacks.
</p>

<p>
  "While it is only probabilistic and not deterministic, the ACE is excellent at capturing the effects of many childhood traumas," said Dr. Bosk.
</p>

<p>
  Quantitative researchers, Bosk says, cannot provide reliable statistics for children living under the threat of deportation,
  the way they can for those living with other stressors such as various types of abuse and addiction.
</p>

<p>
  Without specific data, it is difficult for the medical and social work fields to test and secure financial support for interventions for children in need.
</p>

<p>
  "We do have really good practices and models for children and families," said Bosk. "they are just not very well utilized and not well funded."
</p>

<p>
  Dr. Bosk says that numbers can also be helpful for drafting legislation that might prevent some childhood trauma.
</p>

<p>
  "Good, strong policy can really mitigate some of these experiences we’re talking about."
